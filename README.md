# DictionaryBruteforcer
This is a Brute forcer Dictionary attacker. From  the following, there is a dictionary file denoted by '-d' which contains all multiple passwords which has to be tried, apart from this if a correct password is traced within the text file(dictionary) then it will automatically unzip the file and also return the correct password. This can be used to even brute force facebook, instagram, gmail, snapchat, and other platforms to brute force dictionary keywords and hack the correct password. I am attaching a trial zip file and a trial dictionary file.
Any modification to bruteforce any other platforms can be done by changing the libraries.
